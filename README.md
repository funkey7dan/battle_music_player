# Battle Music Intensity Regulator

## About
Music is important in everything we do.
 When playing a boardgame, you want to be as immersed as possible,
and many random playlist on youtube are a mish-mash of different energies.
I wanted to have manual control over the mood of the game,
and later I decided to try and automate this for Gloomhaven. 

Built using:
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
[Svelte](https://svelte.technology) 
[HowlerJS](https://howlerjs.com/)
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

*You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Usage:
First point the app to the root folder containing your intensity playlists (See example in /public)

  <summary>Folder structure</summary>
